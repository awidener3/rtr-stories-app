This application is an example project used by ["The Road to React" by Robin Wieruch](https://www.roadtoreact.com/) to learn React fundamentals. 

## ‚úèÔ∏è Notes
  
### React Maintenance
* Performance in React
  * **Strict Mode**: helper component that notifies developers in the case of something being wrong in implementation.
    * This may cause unexpected behaviors, such as `useEffect()` hooks running twice when we may expect it once. The result of the `useEffect()` is the same, therefore it does not affect the application. This is called an *idempotent* operation, which means the result of a successfully performed request is independent of the # of times it is executed.
    * "Strict Mode" is only used while in the development environment and is removed during the production build process.
    * When working on an app's performance optimization, you can simply remove the `<StrictMode>` tag at the React entry point. You should add the tags back when finished.
  * **`useEffect()` Updates**: There is no built-in way for a `useEffect()` hook to render only after an *update*.
    * Using the `useRef()` hook, you can create a "made up state" that updates and simulates an update.
    ```js
    const useStorageState = (key, initialState) => {
      const isMounted = useRef(false); // made up state
      const [value, setValue] = useState(localStorage.getItem(key) || initialState);

      useEffect(() => {
        if (!isMounted.current) { // runs on initial render
          isMounted.current = true;
        } else { // runs for every re-render
          localStorage.setItem(key, value);
        }
      }, [value, key]);

      return [value, setValue];
    };
    ```
